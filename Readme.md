## Safari Inline Videos
This tweak was requested on [/r/jailbreak](http://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/385zdu/taking_tweak_requests_for_immediate_developing/crskg0v) by Liamrc

## Features
Safari now plays HTML5 videos inline, instead of full screen. Try it out at [http://i.imgur.com/OZz4qTS.gifv](http://i.imgur.com/OZz4qTS.gifv)

Adds webkit-playsinline to video HTML tags as necessary.

Note: Uses Monolith framework, which is currently in beta.
